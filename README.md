Author: Sankalpa Paudel

This project involves using Python with the pymongo library to interact with MongoDB. The code imports necessary modules such as datetime, sys, argparse, os, and bson.json_util.loads. The objective is to compare the performance of embedded and normalized document models in MongoDB through various queries. These queries will be integrated into separate Python applications utilizing PyMongo.
